Community data inevitably contain errors due to, for example, misidentifications or recording errors, and need correcting.
The goal of the `correct.community` package is to provide a framework for correcting these errors in a reproducible way.

## Installation

You can install correct.community from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("richardjtelford/correct.community")
```


## Data required

- turf community data
- optional subturf data
- taxon list
- turfID list
- siteID list
- corrections

### Step 1

Make a correction template file with `cc_make_template()` and fill it in using Excel or similar.

### Step 2

Import with your favourite data importing function (`readr::read_csv` recommended)

### Step 3

Validate the corrections to check that sites, species, etc are valid.

### Step 4

Classify the errors into different types and iterate over these to fix the errors.

## Initial checks

- (new) taxa are valid NO
- turfID are valid NO
- siteID are valid NO

## Secondary checks

- taxa to correct are in turf NO

## Types of corrections

- rename/merge taxa at global level (all years) NO
- rename/merge at site & year NO
- rename/merge at turf & year (perhaps with revised cover) NO
- new cover for existing taxa NO
- impute cover NO
- delete species NO
- add species NO
- add/delete subturfs NO
- rotate subturf NO
